            <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">I chose the Boston Park Assets dataset from Analyze Boston in order to further explore Boston data and delve into the features offered by parks. I made decisions pertaining to color and interactivity in two Altair visualizations to allow users to view the number of parks in each neighborhood and the features that those parks contain</p>      
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">
            I chose to parse the data into these two visualizations specifically so that the user can first see the big picture and view the number of parks in each neighborhood and then they can delve into each neighborhood and filter by park features to see the spread of features as well as find a neighborhood and park that contain the feature you are searching for. I envision this being used by parents who want to take their children to a park that has a particular feature.

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">I became interested in Analyze Boston while working on our group project this semester. When it came time for this assignment I decided to see what else there was to offer. I found the dataset about parks in the neighborhoods of Boston and I wanted to dig a little deeper. I found that Roxbury and Dorchester have the most parks with 29 and 21 respectively, while Mission Hill and Fenway have the least at 1 and 2.  When looking closer at the features I realized that playgrounds were the most common - appearing in all but one neighborhood, while Hand Ball, Netball, Ping Pong, Pump Track, and Soccer were unique and each only appeared in one park. I also calculated that on average each park has 2.58 features.

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">To create the visualizations I used Altair and Pandas with Python and then embeded them into the site</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">
            I enjoyed finding data and creating a visualization that can tell the story of the Boston Neighborhoods and their parks. I believe that I effectively made design choices to bring the data to life in an engaging and easily accessible way.

         <!-- Add a header for the first vis--> 
        <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">First Visualization</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">The first visualization I created is a Pie Chart with labels. I specified a color scheme so that each neighborhood has a unique color and I kept the alphabetical order of the neighborhoods in the pie chart (instead of ordering from least to most parks) so that it can be easily compared to the legend as well as the other visualization. A tooltip shows the neighborhood and each slice is labeled with the number of parks. In terms of interactivity I added highlighting so that when a location is clicked, the other locations lighten in opacity.</p>  
     
    <!-- Div for first visualization with an ID vis1-->

     <!-- Add a header for the second vis--> 
        <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">Second Visualization</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size:; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">The second visualization is a horizontal stacked bar chart that shows the number of park features found in each neighborhood. Each feature is encoded with a unique color found in the legend. Within the visualization, each neighborhood is a bar that contains the features eg. Playground, Spray Play, and Basketball found in the parks of that neighborhood. Each segment of the bar also includes a number corresponding to the number of that feature. The interactive/dynamic elements include filtering and details on demand. The dropdown found at the bottom can be used to select features - when a feature is selected, only that feature and the neighborhoods that contain that feature are displayed. I decided to only allow whole numbers to mark the x-axis so that when filtered there arenâ€™t tickmarks for 1.2,1.4 etc. The details on demand can be seen by hovering over the bars. Each feature is linked to a park so that when you hover over a feature you can see the name of the park, this is especially helpful when the features are filtered.
